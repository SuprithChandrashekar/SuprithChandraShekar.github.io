This is me writing an intro to this blog post. Resume → Blog → Story.  
Let’s turn bullet points into something more human.  

## 1. Education that Built the Base  

Started off with a **Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering** at R.V. College of Engineering (GPA 8.05/10).  
Now at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, working on my **MS in Industrial Engineering**—finishing Dec 2026.  

## 2. The Deloitte Chapter  

Two roles, two flavors:  

- As a **Business Analyst**, I played the pre-sales game—helping win projects, crunching data, building dashboards, and tightening up strategy. I also researched competitors, supported the PMO on digital transformation initiatives, conducted business process reviews, drove cost optimization efforts, implemented new tools, benchmarked processes, developed KPIs, and contributed to product rationalization and pricing decisions.
- As a **Consultant**, I stepped into digital transformation programs, led initiatives and teams, optimized workflows, and collapsed traditional walls between functional and technical roles faster than a house of cards - to ensure solutions were both technically sound and bsuiness-aligned.

## 3. The Engineering Roots  

Before consulting, I cut my teeth at **Larsen & Toubro Defense** as a Mechanical Engineering Intern.  
- Streamlined documentation → 20% faster retrieval.  
- Reviewed schematics, tested feasibility, and supported system lifecycle planning.  
I also spent time as a **Teaching Assistant**, guiding students through 3D modeling and FEA simulations.  

## 4. Projects that Show the Edge  

A few highlights:  
- **High-Frequency Trading Strategy Generator**: Automating quant research, because who has time to code every idea by hand?  
- **Chicago Weather Dashboard**: Built with APIs + visualization to decode patterns in weather.  
- **Applied Statistics for Market Sentiment**: Crunched the relationship between VIX, sentiment, and S&P500 futures.
- **Thermal Management System for EV Battery Pack**: Designed cooling solutions using MATLAB and ANSYS simulations to prevent thermal runaway in lithium iron phosphate batteries, optimizing for extreme Indian conditions and extending battery life by 800–1000 cycles.  

## 5. Tools of the Trade  

I speak Python, R, MATLAB, C++, JavaScript, Streamlit + Altair, ServiceNow, and simulation platforms like SolidWorks, Catia, and Ansys.  
Oh, and I don’t mind swapping languages either: English, Hindi, Kannada.  

## 6. Wrapping it Up  

This could have been a TL;DR, but let’s be real—you’re here for the punchline:
