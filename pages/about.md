# **About Me**

Hi, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}** — an Industrial Engineering graduate student at UIUC (MS, Dec 2026) with a foundation in data science, software, and systems engineering. I previously worked at Deloitte as a Consultant and Business Analyst, partnering with global clients on ITSM/ITOM transformations, building analytics dashboards, and improving delivery processes. I enjoy turning ideas into working systems, from AI‑assisted quant research tools to clean data visualizations and automation.

On this site you’ll find a few highlights, including my HFT Strategy Generator, an IEX market data processing workflow, and small productivity tools. I like working at the intersection of data, software, and operations where clear problem framing and fast iteration matter.
