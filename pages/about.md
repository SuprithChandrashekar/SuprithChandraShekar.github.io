# **About Me**

Hi, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}** — an M.S Industrial Engineering graduate student at UIUC (Dec 2026) with a foundation in manufacturing, supply chain, quality, and systems engineering. I previously worked at Deloitte as a Consultant and Business Analyst, working with global clients on their digital transformation, driving project scoping, delivery efficiency, and strategic alignment across multi-site operations. I enjoy turning ideas into working systems, from AI‑assisted quant research tools to clean data visualizations and automation.

On this site you’ll find a few highlights, including my HFT Strategy Generator, an IEX market data processing workflow, and small productivity tools. I like working at the intersection of operations, solutioning, and engineering where clear problem framing and robust understanding of a subject matters.
